## Project Description: Spotify Clone Using Django

I developed a Spotify clone using Django, a powerful web framework, to create a full-featured music streaming application. This clone allows users to enjoy a personalized music experience with the following features:

- **User Authentication**: Implemented signup, login, and forgot password functionalities to manage user accounts securely.
- **Playlists**: Users can create and manage playlists, adding their favorite songs to customize their listening experience.
- **Mood-Based Listening**: Songs can be filtered and played based on the user's current mood, enhancing the personalized music experience.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark songs as favorites, making it easy to access and play their preferred tracks quickly.
- **Music Streaming**: Integrated a music player that enables seamless streaming of songs added to playlists.

This project showcases a comprehensive understanding of Django for building dynamic, user-centered web applications with robust authentication and personalized content delivery.
